# ARRAYS IN GO

### What is an Array?
An array is a data structure, with a fixed size, that is used to store data of the same type. 

### Array Declaration (without initialization)
Arrays in Go are declared as follows:

```Go
// name, [number of elements], element data type
	var arrOne [4]int     // this declares an array with 4 integer elements, all elements are 0 because we didn't initialize
	var arrText [3]string // this declares an array with 3 string elements, all elements are empty strings because we didn't initialize
```
